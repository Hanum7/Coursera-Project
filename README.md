In this task, accelerometer data is used to predict how subjects perform weightlifting exercises. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify 20 test cases. This will use the Random Forest model, which is well suited for high-dimensional classification problems. The data comes from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants.
